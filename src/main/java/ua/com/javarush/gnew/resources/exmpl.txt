Deep in the verdant waterways of Xochimilco near Mexico City lies a small island with a history that chills to the bone. The Island of Dolls is a place where countless dolls, in varying states of decay, hang ominously from trees. These dolls, weathered by the elements, are said to be an offering by a grieving caretaker to soothe the restless spirit of a young girl who drowned in the canal nearby. Visitors describe an intense atmosphere, where the silence is broken only by the whispering leaves and the unblinking gazes of plastic figures. Itâ€™s an attraction that blends folklore, sadness, and the supernatural.
