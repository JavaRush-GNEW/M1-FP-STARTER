# Caesar Cipher Encryptor/Decryptor

### What was implemented?
```
All main tasks from the technical requirements were completed. 
The `Encrypt` and `Decrypt` methods function correctly.
```
### What was not implemented?
```
The program does not support command-line interaction via scanner (CLI). 
Instead, a graphical user interface (GUI) was implemented.
```
### Project Features
```
- Multilingual Support: The program supports:
Encryption and decryption of text in English and Ukrainian. 
Automatically detects the language of the text and selects the appropriate alphabet.

- Brute-force Implementation: A brute-force mode is available for decrypting encrypted text.

- Graphical User Interface (GUI): A user-friendly GUI was implemented 
for easier interaction with the program.
